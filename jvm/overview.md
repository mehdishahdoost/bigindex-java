### JVM

>The Java Virtual Machine is an abstract computing machine. Like a real computing machine, it has an instruction set and manipulates various memory areas at run time.

>The Java Virtual Machine knows nothing of the Java programming language, only of a particular binary format, the class file format.
>A class file contains Java Virtual Machine instructions (or bytecodes) and a symbol table, as well as other ancillary information
